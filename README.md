Set myself up as an "Awesome Admin" just to make things a little fun before beginning to create tickets for agents. Added roles and allowed all permissions for the Awesome Admin.

Created a Level II support department as an admin user. Pretty easy to navigate and create in osTicket. Next I will configure some teams.

I created a team of 3 agents including myself. Made up some cool agents to work some tickets. Set permissions for "Black Adam" as a Sys Admin and John Wick as a support agent.

These are SLAs. It is a time limit for hours and days an agent has to resolve tickets for customers. SEV-A has 1 hour, 24/7. SEV-B has 4 hours, 24/7. SEV-C has 8 hours, business hours. Real life SLAs with a couple of unfortunate days and hours to fix them.
